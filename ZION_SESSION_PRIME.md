# NEXT ACTIONS

## Immediate
1. **Verify Git Sync:** Ensure `zion-engine` repo is clean and pushed.
2. **Test Awakening:** Run `session_hook.py` manually to verify it boots without error.
3. **Verify Drive:** Check `gdrive:Zion-Archive/backups/` to confirm rotation is working.

## Strategic
1. **Consolidate:** Stop adding features. Make the existing ones bulletproof.
2. **Truth Engine:** Refine `cognitive_memory.py` tuning based on real usage.
